BUILDING
-------------

Automated building using script:

> build.sh


Manual building steps:

1. in "bsl" directory type 'make'   
2. copy 'bsl' binary to '/boot/home/non-packaged/bin'
1. in "rez" directory type 'make'   
2. copy 'rez' binary to '/boot/home/non-packaged/bin'
4. in 'sum-it' directory type 'make'
5. You have OpenSum-It binary


NOTE! By default build system makes OpenSum-It binary with DEBUG turned on.
